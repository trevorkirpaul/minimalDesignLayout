# Portfolio Layout Idea

This was my first time using SASS which was a pretty awesome experience. It took a while to install since I didnt realize Ruby was so easy to get >.<
I ended up installing a Ruby verion manager that I have no idea how to use before I stumbled upon `sudo apt install ruby`.

I'm doing these layouts so I can get better at the basics of html and css as well as basic node.js server creating and routing. I've just been routing static folders so far though.

Design wise, practice has been paying off as I really like this style so far. If you want to check it out, use it or modify than feel free. 

Soon I'll be focusing on webpack and react along with making a full website. I'll start from the ground up with brand identity and logo design and hopefully create my first official portfolio piece.

Thanks for reading.
